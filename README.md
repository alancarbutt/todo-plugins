## My favorite plugins for todo.txt

I'm including the plugins that I use that I had to modify for use with todo.txt

Thus far, I have had to fix the following plugins

* xp
    * Fixed several BASH specific issues that with the base code from Chris Jones that would not allow me to use the plugin
* setdue
    * Fixed BASH issues
    * Fixed sed call that in some instances deletes all contents in the todo.txt file

More to come...

- [x] Fix xp code and documentation
- [x] Fix setdue issue where sed command deletes all TODOs in the todo.txt file
